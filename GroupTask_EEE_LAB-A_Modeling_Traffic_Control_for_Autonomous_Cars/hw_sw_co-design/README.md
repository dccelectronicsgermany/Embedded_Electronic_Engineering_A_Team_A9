# Hardware Software Co-Design

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete Hardware/Software (HW/SW) Co-Design development of an **Autonomous Intersection Management System (AIMS)**. The project combines **formal verification (UPPAAL)**, **real-time software (FreeRTOS)**, and **hardware acceleration (FPGA)** to design, analyze, and validate a reservation-based intelligent traffic intersection controller.

The objective is to provide a collision-free, deadlock-free, and efficient autonomous intersection capable of coordinating multiple vehicles through Critical Zone (CZ) reservation while satisfying real-time constraints.
